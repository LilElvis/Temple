# Temple
TEMPLE is a traditional text-based adventure game written in C++. My friends and I pioneered our game development careers with this project, working on it for four months to submit in our Game Development Workshop I course. Looking back at the codebase for this project is always tough, but I suppose we all need to start somewhere.
